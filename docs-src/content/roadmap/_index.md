Here you can find information on the future planning of SpectralAnalysis.

#### Assisted analysis
SpectralAnalysis was developed with flexibiltiy in mind, and this has led to many features being included 


##### Hide experimental methods
Optionally hide the parts of the software that are currently in development. This would provide a restricted view of only the key tools to make the selection of the correct tool easier. It should be possible to toggle this option as part of the interface.

#### Free input/export of data
Integration with additional software tools and programming languages by freely importing and exporting data

#### Calibration and alignment
Re-calibration of data is a common request 

#### Options file
Keep track of user options (default colour map, experimental/normal view, etc.)
