This mouse bladded dataset is available from the [PRIDE repository](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001283). It was acquired using the MALDI MSI with a AP-SMALDI imaging source coupled to an Orbitrap mass spectrometer.

The dataset has already been peak picked as part of the conversion process, and so each spectrum contains _m/z_, peak intensity pairs. This requires specific preprocessing to be performed.
