Regions of interest (ROIs) are areas of an image, which can be used as input into subsequent data analysis. ROIs can be defined manually, as explained in this page, or automatically through processing such as [clustering](/basic-usage/clustering).


### Feature List
* [Generate ROI](#generate-roi)
* [Calculate statistics on ROI](#calculate-statistics)
* [Export ROIs](#export-roi)

### Overview {#overview}
The ROI panel can be found on the right on the main interface (number 1 in the image below).

2. Save region of interest list
3. Load region of interest list
4. [View statistics on ROI](#calculate-statistics)
5. [Add/edit/delete ROIs](#generate-roi)

### Generate ROI {#generate-roi}

To create an ROI manually, the `Edit` button on the main interface in the [ROI panel](#overview) must be clicked. This then opens the `ROI List Editor`, shown below, displaying the ion image which was previously active in the main interface.

To create a new ROI, first click the `+` button, and then in the new window, select an ROI name and colour and then click `OK`. This then adds the new ROI to the list (bottom left in the interface). The highlighted ROI is then displayed on top of the image, and any selected tool (defined below) can then be applied directly to the image by clicking and/or dragging.

Pencil
: Assign individual pixels to the ROI.

Line
: Assign all pixels which fall along a line drawn by the user to the ROI.

Rectangle
: Assign all pixels which fall within a rectangle drawn by the user to the ROI.

Ellipse
: Assign all pixels which fall within an ellipse drawn by the user.

Poly
: Define an arbitrary shape .

Eraser
: Toggle button. When active, use any shape to define an area to remove from the current region of interest. When deactivated, areas are added to the ROI.

Threshold
: Assign all pixels ... (see [Threshold](#threshold) for more details).

Move
: Allows dragging of the ROI to a new location.
