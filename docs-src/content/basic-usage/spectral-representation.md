A spectral representation is a spectrum which describes one or more pixels. Examples of spectral representations are:

* Mean spectrum
* Total spectrum
* Basepeak spectrum

These are useful as a means to get an overview of peaks present in the entire dataset or a specific region of interest. Spectral representations can be generated by selecting the `Spectral Representation` option in the menu bar (top of `DataViewer` window).

Mean spectrum
: The mean spectrum contains the mean intensity at each spectral channel.

Total spectrum
: The total spectrum contains the sum of all intensities at each spectral channel.

Basepeak spectrum
: The basepeak spectrum contains the maximum intensity at each spectral channel.
