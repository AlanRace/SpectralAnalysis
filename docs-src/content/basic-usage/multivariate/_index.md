Multivariate analysis covers a set of statistical methods for analysing data where each observation (in this case spectrum) has multiple variables (spectral channels, e.g. *m/z*) and the relationship between these is important. Various multivariate analysis methods are included within SpectralAnalysis, each with its own set of benefits and considerations. 

The most commonly used method is [principal component analysis (PCA)](/basic-usage/multivariate/pca).
