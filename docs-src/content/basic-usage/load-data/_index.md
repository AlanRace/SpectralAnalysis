## Opening Data

When selecting the 'Open' menu, the list of currently implemented [parsers]({{< ref "parser.md" >}}) will be shown, select the appropriate parser for the type of data to be opened.

After selecting the file to open, the 'Select Data Representation' interface will be shown. This enables loading all data in memory (most memory intensive, fastest processing), loading only a subset of the data (limited spectral range and/or a selected region of interest) into memory or leaving the data on the disk (very little memory consumed, slower processing).

1. Select the [data representation]({{< ref "data-representation.md" >}}) to use to load the data (this interface is specific to Data In Memory).
2. Optional spectral channel range to impose when loading data.
3. Optionally select a [region of interest]({{< ref "region-of-interest.md" >}}) to load. Default is the entire dataset.
4. Optionally select a method for [ensuring a consistent spectral axis]({{< ref "ensure-consistent-mz-axis.md" >}}). If data is [not continuous]({{< ref "continuous-vs-profile.md" >}}) then a method must be selected or the data will not load.
5. Load data with selected options.
