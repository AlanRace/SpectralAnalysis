%Eigendecomposition of a upper packed symmetric matrix.
%
%	[VALUES, VECTORS] = SYMMEIG(X, N) where X is a vector 
%   containing the upper triangular of the covariance matrix 
%   in packed storage (packed by columns see: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node123.html)
%   and N is an integer describing the number of columns 
%   in the covariance matrix
