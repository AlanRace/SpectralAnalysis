## Contributing using GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. To contribute code or documentation:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add your new code and test against the [example data](https://alanrace.github.io/SpectralAnalysis/tutorials/).
3. Update the documentation to describe any new or changed features, ideally using the example data to demonstrate this.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache Licence 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/AlanRace/SpectralAnalysis/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/AlanRace/SpectralAnalysis/issues/new).

Bug reports should be as detailed as possible. Maintainers need enough information to be able to recreate the issue to start to fix it.
